assignment            → identifier "=" expression newline

statement             → expression_statement | print_statement
expression_statement  → expression newline
print_statement       → "print" expression newline

expression            → equality 
equality              → comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )*

term                  → factor ( ( "-" | "+" ) factor )* 
factor                → unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* 
unary                 → ( "!" | "-" ) unary | primary 
primary               → number | string

string                → "[ascii]*"
number                → [0-9]\.?[0-9]+
newline               → "\n" | "\r\n"
